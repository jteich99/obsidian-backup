### from [[the fun and efficient note-taking system I use in my PhD]]
Core principles:
1. Write all the time.in your own words many way.
2. Everything is knowledge → non hierarchical
3. Notes are irreducible and a complete thought
4. Knowledge is interconnected
Use in obsidian
- fleeting notes → basic write down of things you think /read/ etc. about
	- highlighting and notes in books and papers
	- write down from where it comes from
- permanent notes → from fleeting notes in your own words
	- small, irreducible notes
	- title has to summarize in a way you can connect later
	- from books
		- write passage from books
		- write in your own words
		- link to book
		- I have books about facts in my books so maybe writing in my own words isn't possible
- connect permanent notes to other ideas in other notes
