* Author: [[Kiyosaki, Robert]]

## Highlights
“Now I know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what this game teaches, I'm free to do and study what my heart wants to study. — location: [104]() ^ref-14956

one dad had a habit of saying, “I can't afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. — location: [223]() ^ref-3069

---
By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. — location: [226]() ^ref-4166

One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.” — location: [238]() ^ref-12832

---
The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the “entitlement” mentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent. — location: [248]() ^ref-24501

Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth. — location: [283]() ^ref-46854

Rich dad said over and over, this point of view, which I call Lesson No. 1. “The poor and the middle class work for money.” “The rich have money work for them.” — location: [547]() ^ref-12295

A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it's short term. It's the bills at the end of the month, the Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money. So they do as their parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time to say, `Is there another way?' Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.” — location: [831]() ^ref-42080

---
I am concerned that too many people are focused too much on money and not their greatest wealth, which is their education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone. — location: [912]() ^ref-60223

Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule. — location: [947]() ^ref-20333

---
Just remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. So how do I start minding my own business? — location: [1241]() ^ref-50084

---
To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column. As stated earlier, the No. 1 rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. — location: [1285]() ^ref-20173

1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it's not a business. It becomes my job. ?. Stocks. ?. Bonds. ?. Mutual funds. ?. Income-generating real estate. ?. Notes (lOUs). ?. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents. ?. 8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market. — location: [1323]() ^ref-21081

For years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox, I did what my rich dad recommended. I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my asset column. I traded real estate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of financial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the better I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company. — location: [1341]() ^ref-47833

As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. — location: [1351]() ^ref-4831

A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. — location: [1356]() ^ref-11005

After you've taken the time and invested in and built your own business, you are now ready to add the magic touch-the biggest secret of the rich. The secret that puts the rich way ahead of the pack. The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own business. — location: [1363]() ^ref-33211

The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power. — location: [1462]() ^ref-46467

You need to know the law and how the system works. If you're ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you're talking about, you have a fighting chance. That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and attorneys. — location: [1465]() ^ref-57230

Whenever I do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise. — location: [1502]() ^ref-24965

---
No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes tumbling down. This is the left brain side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business. — location: [1503]() ^ref-58973

---
No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side. — location: [1506]() ^ref-1439

---
No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know the “technical” aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; the Tickle Me Elmo doll during Christmas 1996 is a case of a technical or emotion-driven market. The other market factor is the “fundamental” or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not make sense based on the current market conditions. — location: [1508]() ^ref-3508

---
No. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the technical skills of accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. An individual with the knowledge of the tax advantages and protection provided by a corporation can get rich so much faster than someone who is an employee or a small-business sole proprietor. It's like the difference between someone walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to long-term wealth. — location: [1518]() ^ref-30090
