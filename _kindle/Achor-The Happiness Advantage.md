## Metadata
* Author: [[Shawn Achor]]

## Highlights
we now know that happiness is the precursor to success, not merely the result. — location: [80]() ^ref-22559

---
“The Mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” — location: [105]() ^ref-50519

---
It turns out that our brains are literally hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or even neutral, but when they are positive. — location: [237]() ^ref-23101

---
we ironically sacrifice happiness for success only to lower our brains’ success rates. — location: [238]() ^ref-7244

---
The Happiness Advantage—Because positive brains have a biological advantage over brains that are neutral or negative, this principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to capitalize on positivity and improve our productivity and performance. — location: [262]() ^ref-16788

---
The Fulcrum and the Lever—How we experience the world, and our ability to succeed within it, constantly changes based on our mindset. This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (our fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (the lever) to be more fulfilled and successful. — location: [264]() ^ref-57265

---
The Tetris Effect—When our brains get stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity, and failure, we set ourselves up to fail. This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunity wherever we look. — location: [266]() ^ref-16003

---
Falling Up—In the midst of defeat, stress, and crisis, our brains map different paths to help us cope. This principle is about finding the mental path that not only leads us up out of failure or suffering, but teaches us to be happier and more successful because of it. — location: [268]() ^ref-29814

---
The Zorro Circle—When challenges loom and we get overwhelmed, our rational brains can get hijacked by emotions. This principle teaches us how to regain control by focusing first on small, manageable goals, and then gradually expanding our circle to achieve bigger and bigger ones. — location: [270]() ^ref-25885

---
The 20-Second Rule—Sustaining lasting change often feels impossible because our willpower is limited. And when willpower fails, we fall back on our old habits and succumb to the path of least resistance. This principle shows how, by making small energy adjustments, we can reroute the path of least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones. — location: [273]() ^ref-46777

---
Social Investment—In the midst of challenges and stress, some people choose to hunker down and retreat within themselves. But the most successful people invest in their friends, peers, and family members to propel themselves forward. This principle teaches us how to invest more in one of the greatest predictors of success and excellence—our social support network. — location: [275]() ^ref-64666

---
The Happiness Advantage starts at a different place. It asks us to be realistic about the present while maximizing our potential for the future. — location: [367]() ^ref-26008

---
Happiness is not the belief that we don’t need to change; it is the realization that we can. — location: [369]() ^ref-31176

---
When we are happy—when our mindset and mood are positive—we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. — location: [506]() ^ref-4012

---
So how do the scientists define happiness? Essentially, as the experience of positive emotions—pleasure combined with deeper feelings of meaning and purpose. Happiness implies a positive mood in the present and a positive outlook for the future. — location: [539]() ^ref-931

---
pleasure, engagement, and meaning. — location: [542]() ^ref-4992

---
happiness is the joy we feel striving after our potential. — location: [547]() ^ref-44227

---
Instead of narrowing our actions down to fight or flight as negative emotions do, positive ones broaden the amount of possibilities we process, making us more thoughtful, creative, and open to new ideas. — location: [606]() ^ref-62026

---
that happiness gives us a real chemical edge on the competition. How? Positive emotions flood our brains with dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that not only make us feel good, but dial up the learning centers of our brains to higher levels. They help us organize new information, keep that information in the brain longer, and retrieve it faster later on. And they enable us to make and sustain more neural connections, which allows us to think more quickly and creatively, become more skilled at complex analysis and problem solving, and see and invent new ways of doing things. — location: [613]() ^ref-28750

---
students who were told to think about the happiest day of their lives right before taking a standardized math test outperformed their peers. — location: [643]() ^ref-7051

---
Even the smallest shots of positivity can give someone a serious competitive edge. — location: [666]() ^ref-5127

---
Because in addition to broadening our intellectual and creative capacities, positive emotions also provide a swift antidote to physical stress and anxiety, what psychologists call “the undoing effect.” — location: [681]() ^ref-38198

---
While we each have a happiness baseline that we fluctuate around on a daily basis, with concerted effort, we can raise that baseline permanently so that even when we are going up and down, we are doing so at a higher level. — location: [706]() ^ref-64886

---
Each activity listed below not only gives us a quick boost of positive emotions, improving our performance and focus in the moment; but if performed habitually over time, each has been shown to help permanently raise our happiness baseline. — location: [716]() ^ref-27753

---
Meditate. — location: [723]() ^ref-23934

---
research even shows that regular meditation can permanently rewire the brain to raise levels of happiness, lower stress, even improve immune function. — location: [728]() ^ref-30378

---
Find Something to Look Forward To. — location: [730]() ^ref-54969

---
Often, the most enjoyable part of an activity is the anticipation. — location: [732]() ^ref-29555

---
Commit Conscious Acts of Kindness. — location: [735]() ^ref-2808

---
acts of altruism—giving to friends and strangers alike—decrease stress and strongly contribute to enhanced mental health. — location: [736]() ^ref-65380

---
Infuse Positivity Into Your Surroundings. — location: [744]() ^ref-33640

---
Making time to go outside on a nice day also delivers a huge advantage; one study found that spending 20 minutes outside in good weather not only boosted positive mood, but broadened thinking and improved working memory. — location: [748]() ^ref-11574

---
Exercise. — location: [757]() ^ref-45705

---
Physical activity can boost mood and enhance our work performance in a number of other ways as well, by improving motivation and feelings of mastery, reducing stress and anxiety, and helping us get into flow—that “locked in” feeling of total engagement that we usually get when we’re at our most productive. — location: [758]() ^ref-61554

---
Spend Money (but Not on Stuff). — location: [769]() ^ref-60941

---
Contrary to the popular saying, money can buy happiness, but only if used to do things as opposed to simply have things. — location: [769]() ^ref-56123

---
Exercise a Signature Strength. — location: [782]() ^ref-24467

---
Studies have shown that the more you use your signature strengths in daily life, the happier you become. — location: [791]() ^ref-32450

---
during a talk, one woman in the audience sat scowling — location: [850]() ^ref-4701

---
In other words, while we of course can’t change reality through sheer force of will alone, we can use our brain to change how we process the world, and that in turn changes how we react to it. — location: [909]() ^ref-37837

---
Our power to maximize our potential is based on two important things: (1) the length of our lever—how much potential power and possibility we believe we have, and (2) the position of our fulcrum—the mindset with which we generate the power to change. — location: [925]() ^ref-32686

---
The most successful people adopt a mindset that not only makes their workdays more bearable, but also helps them work longer, harder, and faster than their negative mindset peers. — location: [1027]() ^ref-19545

---
the renewed enthusiasm for my work came when I ignored the constraint entirely and thought only of the intrinsic value I derived from the activity itself, instead of simply when it was “due.” — location: [1048]() ^ref-16686

---
“use” the material I was reading later on. When we reconnect ourselves with the pleasure of the “means,” as opposed to only focusing on the “ends,” we adopt a mindset more conducive not only to enjoyment, but to better results. — location: [1049]() ^ref-12061

---
When we reconnect ourselves with the pleasure of the “means,” as opposed to only focusing on the “ends,” we adopt a mindset more conducive not only to enjoyment, but to better results. — location: [1050]() ^ref-51583

---
But if you change the fulcrum so that you conceive of such free time as a chance to learn and practice new things, to recharge your batteries and connect with others, you’ll be able to leverage the power of that rest time and return stronger than before. — location: [1063]() ^ref-857

---
the more you believe in your own ability to succeed, the more likely it is that you will. — location: [1066]() ^ref-25451

---
Those with a “fixed mindset” believe that their capabilities are already set, while those with a “growth mindset” believe that they can enhance their basic qualities through effort. — location: [1104]() ^ref-5091

---
“although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience.” — location: [1106]() ^ref-62003

---
The researchers suggest a number of reasons a growth mindset propels students to further success, but it basically comes down to motivation. When we believe there will be a positive payoff for our effort, we work harder instead of succumbing to helplessness. — location: [1114]() ^ref-42086

---
Those who simply believed in their own power to change followed a course of action that maximized their college performance. — location: [1124]() ^ref-62827

---
When you make these larger connections, your mundane tasks not only become more palatable, but you perform them with far greater dedication, and see greater returns in performance as a result. — location: [1169]() ^ref-35393

---
You can have the best job in the world, but if you can’t find the meaning in it, you won’t enjoy it, whether you are a movie maker or an NFL playmaker. — location: [1186]() ^ref-24297

---
the best managers and leaders view each interaction as an opportunity to prime their employees for excellence. — location: [1202]() ^ref-13409

---
The expectations we have about our children, co-workers, and spouses—whether or not they are ever voiced—can make that expectation a reality. — location: [1224]() ^ref-10963

---
Turns out that no matter what their motivations might have been before working for these managers, employees typically become the kind of worker their manager expects them to be. Here is the Pygmalion Effect in action. — location: [1232]() ^ref-11770

---
We want to push the limits of possibility as far as they can go, not limit them in the way too many discouraging bosses, parents, teachers, or media stories tell us they should be limited. — location: [1251]() ^ref-39812

---
when we believe we can do more and achieve more (or when others believe it for us), that is often the precise reason we do achieve more. — location: [1254]() ^ref-23416

---
Constantly scanning the world for the negative comes with a great cost. It undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers our motivation and ability to accomplish goals. — location: [1327]() ^ref-61801

---
The problem comes when individuals cannot “compartmentalize” their abilities. And when that happens, not only do they miss out on the Happiness Advantage, but their pessimistic, fault-finding mindset makes them far more susceptible to depression, stress, poor physical health, and even substance abuse. — location: [1361]() ^ref-15898

---
This is the essence of a Negative Tetris Effect: a cognitive pattern that decreases our overall success rates. — location: [1364]() ^ref-54502

---
“My experience is what I agree to attend to.” — location: [1367]() ^ref-7823

---
That’s the goal of a Positive Tetris Effect: Instead of creating a cognitive pattern that looks for negatives and blocks success, it trains our brains to scan the world for the opportunities and ideas that allow our success rate to grow. — location: [1418]() ^ref-15209

---
When our brains constantly scan for and focus on the positive, we profit from three of the most important tools available to us: happiness, gratitude, and optimism. — location: [1420]() ^ref-22231

---
Countless other studies have shown that consistently grateful people are more energetic, emotionally intelligent, forgiving, and less likely to be depressed, anxious, or lonely. And it’s not that people are only grateful because they are happier, either; gratitude has proven to be a significant cause of positive outcomes. — location: [1425]() ^ref-54572

---
Studies have shown that optimists set more goals (and more difficult goals) than pessimists, and put more effort into attaining those goals, stay more engaged in the face of difficulty, and rise above obstacles more easily. — location: [1432]() ^ref-59970

---
Optimists also cope better in high stress situations and are better able to maintain high levels of well-being during times of hardship—all skills that are crucial to high performance in a demanding work environment. — location: [1434]() ^ref-13633

---
The difference between people who capitalize on these chances and those who watch them pass by (or miss them entirely) is all a matter of focus. — location: [1450]() ^ref-54391

---
Psychologists call this “predictive encoding”: Priming yourself to expect a favorable outcome actually encodes your brain to recognize the outcome when it does in fact arise. — location: [1453]() ^ref-23004

---
The best way to kick-start this is to start making a daily list of the good things in your job, your career, and your life. — location: [1469]() ^ref-59182

---
When you write down a list of “three good things” that happened that day, your brain will be forced to scan the last 24 hours for potential positives—things that brought small or large laughs, feelings of accomplishment at work, a strengthened connection with family, a glimmer of hope for the future. — location: [1471]() ^ref-2968

---
The better they got at scanning the world for good things to write down, the more good things they saw, without even trying, wherever they looked. — location: [1479]() ^ref-6610

---
We have long known that venting about hardships and suffering can provide welcome relief, but researchers Chad Burton and Laura King have found that journaling about positive experiences has at least an equally powerful effect. — location: [1483]() ^ref-46090

---
and the clarity of your thinking at the moment. The most successful decisions come when we are thinking clearly and creatively enough to recognize all the paths available to us, and accurately predict where that path will lead. The problem is that when we are stressed or in crisis, many people miss the most important path of all: the path up. — location: [1578]() ^ref-44338

---
The most successful decisions come when we are thinking clearly and creatively enough to recognize all the paths available to us, and accurately predict where that path will lead. The problem is that when we are stressed or in crisis, many people miss the most important path of all: the path up. — location: [1579]() ^ref-6848

---
Study after study shows that if we are able to conceive of a failure as an opportunity for growth, we are all the more likely to experience that growth. — location: [1589]() ^ref-49602

---
By scanning our mental map for positive opportunities, and by rejecting the belief that every down in life leads us only further downward, we give ourselves the greatest power possible: the ability to move up not despite the setbacks, but because of them. — location: [1592]() ^ref-11392

---
In other words, the people who can most successfully get themselves up off the mat are those who define themselves not by what has happened to them, but by what they can make out of what has happened. These are the people who actually use adversity to find the path forward. They speak not just of “bouncing back,” but of “bouncing forward.” — location: [1624]() ^ref-42253

---
“things do not necessarily happen for the best, but some people are able to make the best out of things that happen.” — location: [1631]() ^ref-35280

---
But the problem is, when we eliminate any upward options from our mental maps, and worse, eliminate our motivation to search for them, we end up undermining our ability to tackle the challenge at hand. — location: [1724]() ^ref-21945

---
Others—the most successful among us—know that it’s not the adversity itself, but what we do with it that determines our fate. — location: [1737]() ^ref-61337

---
One way to help ourselves see the path from adversity to opportunity is to practice the ABCD model of interpretation: Adversity, Belief, Consequence, and Disputation. — location: [1841]() ^ref-39712

---
Disputation involves first telling ourselves that our belief is just that—a belief, not fact—and then challenging (or disputing) it. — location: [1847]() ^ref-24223

---
Adversities, no matter what they are, simply don’t hit us as hard as we think they will. Just knowing this quirk of human psychology—that our fear of consequences is always worse than the consequences themselves—can help us move toward a more optimistic interpretation of the downs we will inevitably face. — location: [1865]() ^ref-44368

---
Success is about more than simple resilience. It’s about using that downward momentum to propel ourselves in the opposite direction. It’s about capitalizing on setbacks and adversity to become even happier, even more motivated, and even more successful. It’s not falling down, it’s falling up. — location: [1871]() ^ref-29613

---
But none of these achievements would ever have been possible had he not first learned to master that small circle. Before that moment, Alejandro had no command over his emotions, no sense of his own skill, no real faith in his ability to accomplish a goal, and—worst of all—no feeling of control over his own fate. Only after he masters that first circle does he start to become Zorro, the legend. — location: [1889]() ^ref-52653

---
One of the biggest drivers of success is the belief that our behavior matters; that we have control over our future. Yet when our stresses and workloads seem to mount faster than our ability to keep up, feelings of control are often the first things to go, especially when we try to tackle too much at once. If, however, we first concentrate our efforts on small manageable goals, we regain the feeling of control so crucial to performance. — location: [1894]() ^ref-4466

---
Among students, greater feelings of control lead not only to higher levels of happiness, but also to higher grades and more motivation to pursue the careers they really want. — location: [1902]() ^ref-2993

---
psychologists have found that these kinds of gains in productivity, happiness, and health have less to do with how much control we actually have and more with how much control we think we have. — location: [1908]() ^ref-20563

---
the most successful people, in work and in life, are those who have what psychologists call an “internal locus of control,” the belief that their actions have a direct effect on their outcomes. — location: [1910]() ^ref-6945

---
Most of our daily challenges are better served by the Thinker, but unfortunately, when we’re feeling stressed or out of control, the Jerk tends to take over. — location: [1955]() ^ref-20620

---
The first goal we need to conquer—or circle we need to draw—is self-awareness. — location: [2003]() ^ref-31733

---
Experiments show that when people are primed to feel high levels of distress, the quickest to recover are those who can identify how they are feeling and put those feelings into words. — location: [2004]() ^ref-39229

---
your next goal should be to identify which aspects of the situation you have control over and which you don’t. — location: [2009]() ^ref-3723

---
The point is to tease apart the stresses that we have to let go of because they’re out of our hands, while at the same time identifying the areas where our efforts will have a real impact, so that we can then focus our energy accordingly. — location: [2012]() ^ref-33051

---
By narrowing their scope of action, and focusing their energy and efforts, the likelihood of success increases. — location: [2015]() ^ref-63293

---
By tackling one small challenge at a time—a narrow circle that slowly expands outward—we can relearn that our actions do have a direct effect on our outcomes, that we are largely the masters of our own fates. With an increasingly internal locus of control and a greater confidence in our abilities, we can then expand our efforts outward. — location: [2018]() ^ref-6095

---
But in the real world, this all-or-nothing mindset nearly guarantees failure. Furthermore, the feelings that result from frustrated attempts and overwhelming stressors hijack our brain, jumpstarting that vicious and insidious cycle of helplessness that puts our goals even further out of reach. — location: [2037]() ^ref-57866

---
Because in life, knowledge is only part of the battle. Without action, knowledge is often meaningless. — location: [2144]() ^ref-12687

---
As the researchers wrote, “many widely different forms of self-control draw on a common resource, or self-control strength, which is quite limited and hence can be depleted readily.”10 Put another way, our willpower weakens the more we use it. — location: [2258]() ^ref-9555

---
Inactivity is simply the easiest option. Unfortunately, we don’t enjoy it nearly as much as we think we do. — location: [2273]() ^ref-25134

---
On the other hand, “active leisure” like hobbies, games, and sports enhance our concentration, engagement, motivation, and sense of enjoyment. — location: [2284]() ^ref-8585

---
“Why would we spend four times more time doing something that has less than half the chance of making us feel good?” — location: [2288]() ^ref-62119

---
And whether we’re aware or it or not, default options are everywhere, shaping our choices and our behavior in all areas of our lives. — location: [2312]() ^ref-45888

---
It’s not the sheer number and volume of distractions that gets us into trouble; it’s the ease of access to them. — location: [2354]() ^ref-42574

---
If I couldn’t use self-control to ingrain the habit, at least not for an extended period, I now wondered: What if I could eliminate the amount of activation energy it took to get started? — location: [2367]() ^ref-5038

---
What I had done here, essentially, was put the desired behavior on the path of least resistance, so it actually took less energy and effort to pick up and practice the guitar than to avoid it. — location: [2371]() ^ref-17060

---
Lower the activation energy for habits you want to adopt, and raise it for habits you want to avoid. The more we can lower or even eliminate the activation energy for our desired actions, the more we enhance our ability to jump-start positive change. — location: [2375]() ^ref-61170

---
Eliminating the choices and reducing the activation energy made getting up and going to the gym the default mode. As a result, once I ingrained a lifetime positive habit of morning exercise, I now don’t have to sleep in my gym clothes anymore. — location: [2462]() ^ref-29785

---
In his brilliant book The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains how setting rules in advance can free us from the constant barrage of willpower-depleting choices that make a real difference in our lives. — location: [2474]() ^ref-26102

---
And the key to daily practice is to put your desired — location: [2505]() ^ref-54296

---
The key to their use—to permanent, positive change—is to create habits that automatically pay dividends, without continued concerted effort or extensive reserves of willpower. The key to creating these habits is ritual, repeated practice, until the actions become ingrained in your brain’s neural chemistry. And the key to daily practice is to put your desired actions as close to the path of least resistance as humanly possible. Identify the activation energy—the time, the choices, the mental and physical effort they require—and then reduce it. If you can cut the activation energy for those habits that lead to success, even by as little as 20 seconds at a time, it won’t be long before you start reaping their benefits. The first step metaphorically—and sometimes literally—is just to get your shoes on. — location: [2503]() ^ref-30077

---
7–that when we encounter an unexpected challenge or threat, the only way to save ourselves is to hold on tight to the people around us and not let go. — location: [2550]() ^ref-63562

---
The most successful people take the exact opposite approach. Instead of turning inward, they actually hold tighter to their social support. Instead of divesting, they invest. Not only are these people happier, but they are more productive, engaged, energetic, and resilient. They know that their social relationships are the single greatest investment they can make in the Happiness Advantage. — location: [2574]() ^ref-49992

---
That’s because when we have a community of people we can count on—spouse, family, friends, colleagues—we multiply our emotional, intellectual, and physical resources. We bounce back from setbacks faster, accomplish more, and feel a greater sense of purpose. Furthermore, the effect on our happiness, and therefore on our ability to profit from the Happiness Advantage, is both immediate and long-lasting. — location: [2588]() ^ref-41750

---
So in essence, investing in social connections means that you’ll find it easier to interpret adversity as a path to growth and opportunity; and when you do have to experience the stress, you’ll bounce back from it faster and better protected against its long-term negative effects. — location: [2630]() ^ref-63660

---
Because individuals who invest in their social support systems are simply better equipped to thrive in even the most difficult circumstances, while those who withdraw from the people around them effectively cut off every line of protection they have available, at the very moment they need them most. — location: [2640]() ^ref-59036

---
We can’t always stop the 350-pound linemen flying at us, but we can ALL invest in a strong offensive line. And that can make all the difference. — location: [2668]() ^ref-62672

---
The most successful people I’ve worked with know that even in an extraordinarily competitive environment, we are more equipped to handle challenges and obstacles when we pool the resources of those around us and capitalize on even the smallest moments we spend interacting with others. — location: [2695]() ^ref-57806

---
“The people we interviewed from good-to-great companies clearly loved what they did largely because they loved who they did it with.” — location: [2724]() ^ref-37030

---
Not only do we need to invest in new relationships, we should always be reinvesting in our current relationships because, like our stocks, social support networks grow stronger the longer they are held. — location: [2818]() ^ref-20908

---
When caught in a fire, holding on to others is the best chance we have for successfully finding our way out of the maze. And in everyday life, both at work and at home, our social support can prove the difference between succumbing to the cult of the average and achieving our fullest potential. — location: [2907]() ^ref-12409

---
As we saw in Principle 6, your thoughts and actions are constantly shaping and reshaping the neural pathways in the brain. This means that the more you practice the exercises outlined in this book, and the more you shift your mindset toward the positive, the more you cement these habits for the long haul. — location: [2926]() ^ref-56985

---
The effects of one principle become the trigger for another, so that they become far more than just the sum of their parts. Together, they can take us farther than any one could on its own. — location: [2936]() ^ref-54152

---
As we pass through the day, our brains are constantly processing the feelings of the people around us, taking note of the inflection in someone’s voice, the look behind their eyes, the stoop of their shoulders. In fact, the amygdala can read and identify an emotion in another person’s face within 33 milliseconds, and then just as quickly prime us to feel the same. — location: [2997]() ^ref-4735

---
In fact, emotions are so shared, organizational psychologists have found that each workplace develops its own group emotion, or “group affective tone,” which over time creates shared “emotion norms” that are proliferated and reinforced by the behavior, both verbal and nonverbal, of the employees. — location: [3010]() ^ref-53787

---
So just one positive team member—one person using the Happiness Advantage—can affect both the individual attitudes and performance of those around him, as well as the dynamic and accomplishments of the group as a whole. — location: [3031]() ^ref-23983

---
the ripple effect is the perfect example of how there are no real discernible limits to our influence and our power. — location: [3081]() ^ref-46006

---
Because we now also know that it’s not just our own individual success that orbits around our happiness. By making changes within ourselves, we can actually bring the benefits of the Happiness Advantage to our teams, our organizations, and everyone around us. — location: [3086]() ^ref-14121
