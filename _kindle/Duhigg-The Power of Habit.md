## Highlights
It was that Lisa had focused on changing just one habit—smoking—at first. — location: [96]() ^ref-52049

---
By focusing on one pattern—what is known as a “keystone habit”—Lisa had taught herself how to reprogram the other routines in her life, as well. — location: [97]() ^ref-20134

---
“All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,” William James wrote in 1892. — location: [114]() ^ref-21742

Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work. — location: [136]() ^ref-61305

I tell my soldiers all the time, there’s nothing you can’t do if you get the habits right.” — location: [177]() ^ref-40384

It was clear to Squire that Eugene was absorbing new information. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone find a jar of nuts when he couldn’t say where the kitchen was located? Or find his way home when he had no idea which house was his? How, Squire wondered, were new patterns forming inside Eugene’s damaged brain? — location: [330]() ^ref-39531

---
The basal ganglia, in other words, stored habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep. — location: [379]() ^ref-59317

---
By learning to observe the cues and rewards, though, we can change the routines. — location: [538]() ^ref-4896

“Then I met E.P., and saw how rich life can be even if you can’t remember it. The brain has this amazing ability to find happiness even when the memories of it are gone. — location: [548]() ^ref-3104

---
He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what makes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop. — location: [622]() ^ref-15438

---
That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards. — location: [659]() ^ref-28852

---
This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence. — location: [834]() ^ref-28450

unsatisfied, can build until a meeting is filled with antsy executives checking their buzzing BlackBerrys under the table, even if they know it’s probably only their latest fantasy football results. (On the other hand, if someone disables the buzzing—and, thus, removes the cue—people can work for hours without thinking to check their in-boxes.) — location: [859]() ^ref-56630

(On the other hand, if someone disables the buzzing—and, thus, removes the cue—people can work for hours without thinking to check their in-boxes.) — location: [861]() ^ref-59923

---
But to overpower the habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior. — location: [868]() ^ref-30785

---
However, the reason they continued—why it became a habit—was because of a specific reward they started to crave. — location: [875]() ^ref-36770

---
Eventually, that craving will make it easier to push through the gym doors every day. — location: [982]() ^ref-59275

---
The craving drove the habit loop. — location: [989]() ^ref-51752

---
Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier. — location: [1001]() ^ref-40109

---
If you identify the cues and rewards, you can change the routine. — location: [1267]() ^ref-57777

---
Belief is easier when it occurs within a community. — location: [1440]() ^ref-46067

---
We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. — location: [1481]() ^ref-14418

---
For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. — location: [1484]() ^ref-20413

---
If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. — location: [1490]() ^ref-44602

If I could start disrupting the habits around one thing, it would spread throughout the entire company.” — location: [1575]() ^ref-12423

“keystone habits,” — location: [1577]() ^ref-47680

---
Some habits, in other words, matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives. — location: [1577]() ^ref-58331

---
Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything. — location: [1578]() ^ref-22763

---
Keystone habits say that success doesn’t depend on getting every single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. — location: [1579]() ^ref-61369

---
The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns. — location: [1581]() ^ref-55210

---
The key to protecting Alcoa employees, O’Neill believed, was understanding why injuries happened in the first place. And to understand why injuries happened, you had to study how the manufacturing process was going wrong. To understand how things were going wrong, you had to bring in people who could educate workers about quality control and the most efficient work processes, so that it would be easier to do everything right, since correct work is also safer work. — location: [1659]() ^ref-59489

Making your bed every morning is correlated with better productivity, a greater sense of well-being, and stronger skills at sticking with a budget. — location: [1704]() ^ref-15025

---
But somehow those initial shifts start chain reactions that help other good habits take hold. — location: [1706]() ^ref-48352

“small win.” — location: [1749]() ^ref-26041

---
A huge body of research has shown that small wins have enormous power, an influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves. — location: [1751]() ^ref-19814

---
“Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.” — location: [1752]() ^ref-36422

---
Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach. — location: [1753]() ^ref-19867

---
by creating structures that help other habits to flourish. — location: [1866]() ^ref-48918

---
But this keystone habit—food journaling—created a structure that helped other habits to flourish. Six months into the study, people who kept daily food records had lost twice as much weight as everyone else. — location: [1886]() ^ref-4526

---
This is the final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained. Keystone habits make tough choices—such as firing a top executive—easier, because when that person violates the culture, it’s clear they have to go. — location: [1929]() ^ref-27046

“grit,” which they defined as the tendency to work “strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress.” — location: [1939]() ^ref-50994

Willpower is a learnable skill, something that can be taught the same way kids learn to do math and say “thank you.” — location: [2072]() ^ref-14936

---
If willpower is a skill, Muraven wondered, then why doesn’t it remain constant from day to day? He suspected there was more to willpower than the earlier experiments had revealed. — location: [2085]() ^ref-57063

---
Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.” — location: [2116]() ^ref-9700

---
“If you want to do something that requires willpower—like going for a run after work—you have to conserve your willpower muscle during the day,” Muraven told me. “If you use it up too early on tedious tasks like writing emails or filling out complicated and boring expense forms, all the strength will be gone by the time you get home.” — location: [2121]() ^ref-14577

---
As people strengthened their willpower muscles in one part of their lives—in the gym, or a money management program—that strength spilled over into what they ate or how hard they worked. Once willpower became stronger, it touched everything. — location: [2143]() ^ref-40558

---
Again, as their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to spill over into other parts of their lives. — location: [2148]() ^ref-39712

---
“People get better at regulating their impulses. They learn how to distract themselves from temptations. And once you’ve gotten into that willpower groove, your brain is practiced at helping you focus on a goal.” — location: [2151]() ^ref-33036

---
Put another way, the patients’ plans were built around inflection points when they knew their pain—and thus the temptation to quit—would be strongest. The patients were telling themselves how they were going to make it over the hump. — location: [2213]() ^ref-64835

---
Starbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of adversity by giving them willpower habit loops. — location: [2240]() ^ref-19962

---
“We’ve found this again and again,” Muraven told me. “When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons—if they feel like it’s a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else—it’s much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they’re just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. In both cases, people ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.” — location: [2324]() ^ref-12584

Or, put in language that people use outside of theoretical economics, it may seem like most organizations make rational choices based on deliberate decision making, but that’s not really how companies operate at all. Instead, firms are guided by long-held organizational habits, patterns that often emerge from thousands of employees’ independent decisions.6.16 And these habits have more profound impacts than anyone previously understood. — location: [2473]() ^ref-31004

---
The problem with sabotage is that even if it’s good for you, it’s usually bad for the firm. So at most companies, an unspoken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too rough, your peers will unite against you. On the other hand, if you focus on boosting your own department, rather than undermining your rival, you’ll probably get taken care of over time. — location: [2510]() ^ref-49951

---
For an organization to work, leaders must cultivate habits that both create a real and balanced peace and, paradoxically, make it absolutely clear who’s in charge. — location: [2556]() ^ref-62058

reform is usually possible only once a sense of crisis takes hold. — location: [2727]() ^ref-12932

---
The same kinds of shifts are possible at any company where institutional habits—through thoughtlessness or neglect—have created toxic truces. A company with dysfunctional habits can’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisis—or create the perception of crisis—and cultivate the sense that something must change, until everyone is finally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day. — location: [2762]() ^ref-54691

But as marketers and psychologists figured out long ago, if we start our shopping sprees by loading up on healthy stuff, we’re much more likely to buy Doritos, Oreos, and frozen pizza when we encounter them later on. — location: [2840]() ^ref-60762

The areas that process music, in other words, are designed to seek out patterns and look for familiarity. — location: [3094]() ^ref-23723

Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound. — location: [3098]() ^ref-27320

Movements don’t emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of friendship, grow through the habits of communities, and are sustained by new habits that change participants’ sense of self. — location: [3721]() ^ref-1457

To pathological gamblers, near misses looked like wins. Their brains reacted almost the same way. But to a nonpathological gambler, a near miss was like a loss. People without a gambling problem were better at recognizing that a near miss means you still lose.” — location: [4020]() ^ref-27753

“Some thinkers,” Aristotle wrote in Nicomachean Ethics, “hold that it is by nature that people become good, others that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” For Aristotle, habits reigned supreme. The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.” — location: [4097]() ^ref-4014

---
However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines, and find alternatives. You must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it—and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a different aspect of why that control is real. — location: [4108]() ^ref-28303

---
Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work. — location: [4120]() ^ref-55789

---
If you believe you can change—if you make it a habit—the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. — location: [4150]() ^ref-45263

Individuals and habits are all different, and so the specifics of diagnosing and changing the patterns in our lives differ from person to person and behavior to behavior. — location: [4182]() ^ref-60368

THE FRAMEWORK: • Identify the routine • Experiment with rewards • Isolate the cue • Have a plan — location: [4193]() ^ref-31833

---
To understand your own habits, you need to identify the components of your loops. Once you have diagnosed the habit loop of a particular behavior, you can look for ways to supplant old vices with new routines. — location: [4198]() ^ref-52831

Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings. But we’re often not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors. — location: [4214]() ^ref-4852

First, it forces a momentary awareness of what you are thinking or feeling. — location: [4235]() ^ref-57527

You can change to a better routine by planning for the cue and choosing a behavior that delivers the reward you are craving. What you need is a plan. — location: [4304]() ^ref-50164

Sometimes change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit operates—once you diagnose the cue, the routine and the reward—you gain power over it. — location: [4325]() ^ref-23875
