a life filled with deep thinking is happy because contemplation is an “activity that is appreciated for its own sake . . . nothing is gained from it except the act of contemplation.” — location: [1969]() ^ref-23572

---
a life well lived requires activities that serve no other purpose than the satisfaction that the activity itself generates. — location: [1972]() ^ref-33157

---
if your life consists only of actions whose “worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve,” you’re vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, Is this all there is to life? One solution to this despair, he notes, is to follow Aristotle’s lead and embrace pursuits that provide you a “source of inward joy.” — location: [1974]() ^ref-34551

---
These intrepid souls almost always report that the disconnection generates a feeling of emotional distress. — location: [1984]() ^ref-65002

Expending more energy in your leisure, Bennett tells us, can end up energizing you more. He’s reworking the old entrepreneurial adage “You have to spend money to make money” into the language of personal vitality. — location: [2092]() ^ref-14854

---
Leisure Lesson #2: Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world. — location: [2159]() ^ref-14865

---
supercharged socializing—interactions with higher intensity levels than are common in polite society. — location: [2183]() ^ref-64205

---
The most successful social leisure activities share two traits. First, they require you to spend time with other people in person. — location: [2244]() ^ref-48098

---
The second trait is that the activity provides some sort of structure for the social interaction, including rules you have to follow, insider terminology or rituals, and often a shared goal. — location: [2246]() ^ref-18650

---
Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions. — location: [2251]() ^ref-55616

The philosophy behind a Mouse Book is that it can fit into your pocket next to your phone. Whenever you feel the urge to pull out your phone for a quick hit of distraction, you can instead pull out the Mouse Book and read a few pages of something deeper. — location: [2257]() ^ref-49308

---
Another key aspect of the Mouse Book Club model is helping readers understand and discuss the books they’re sent, enabling them to maximize the value they receive from their reading experience. — location: [2268]() ^ref-43639

---
I’m pointing this out to push back on the idea that high-quality leisure requires a nostalgic turning back of time to a pre-internet era. — location: [2274]() ^ref-14841

---
to escape the drain of low-value digital habits, it’s important to first put in place high-quality leisure activities. — location: [2281]() ^ref-39041

---
You can’t, in other words, build a billion-dollar empire like Facebook if you’re wasting hours every day using a service like Facebook. — location: [2365]() ^ref-19154

---
schedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure. — location: [2376]() ^ref-65056

---
I suggest you strategize this part of your life with a two-level approach consisting of both a seasonal and weekly leisure plan. — location: [2445]() ^ref-34726

---
A seasonal leisure plan is something that you put together three times a year: at the beginning of the fall (early September), at the beginning of the winter (January), and at the beginning of summer (early May). — location: [2447]() ^ref-61493

---
For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things. — location: [2483]() ^ref-12892

---
The more you see these leisure plans as just part of your normal scheduling—and not some separate and potentially optional endeavor—the more likely you are to succeed in following them. — location: [2490]() ^ref-955

---
I’ve noticed that once someone becomes more intentional about their leisure, they tend to find more of it in their life. — location: [2503]() ^ref-59327

it’s tempting to crave the release of having nothing to do—whole blocks of time with no schedule, no expectations, and no activity beyond whatever seems to catch your attention in the moment. These decompression sessions have their place, but their rewards are muted, as they tend to devolve toward low-quality activities like mindless phone swiping and half-hearted binge-watching. For the many different reasons argued in the preceding pages, investing energy into something hard but worthwhile almost always returns much richer rewards. — location: [2508]() ^ref-20920

---
Critical use is a critical problem for the digital attention economy. — location: [2588]() ^ref-30414

It emphasizes that the smartphone versions of these services are much more adept at hijacking your attention than the versions accessed through a web browser on your laptop or desktop computer — location: [2621]() ^ref-59054

if you’re going to use social media, stay far away from the mobile versions of these services, as these pose a significantly bigger risk to your time and attention. — location: [2629]() ^ref-40432

---
By removing your ability to access social media at any moment, you reduce its ability to become a crutch deployed to distract you from bigger voids in your life. — location: [2633]() ^ref-51039

the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously — location: [2690]() ^ref-21763

---

Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the full concentration of their users. . . . Slow Media measure themselves in production, appearance and content against high standard of quality and stand out from their fast-paced and short-lived counterparts. — location: [2785]() ^ref-14615

---
You don’t make a conscious decision about each of the sites and feeds you end up visiting; instead, once the sequence is activated, it unfolds on autopilot. — location: [2803]() ^ref-13507

---
isolating your news consumption to set times during the week. — location: [2835]() ^ref-6721

This philosophy is meant to be a human bulwark against the foreign artificiality of electronic communication, a way to take advantage of the wonders that these innovations do in fact provide (Maine and Texas, it turns out, did have some useful things to say once connected), without allowing their mysterious nature to subvert our human urge to build a meaningful and satisfying life. — location: [2947]() ^ref-19559
