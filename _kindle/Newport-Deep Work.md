## Highlights
Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. — location: [31]() ^ref-33339

---
Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity. — location: [33]() ^ref-1856

---
Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. — location: [73]() ^ref-48912

---
Larger efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business strategy or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality. — location: [77]() ^ref-12964

---
Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today. — location: [148]() ^ref-33316

---
To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances. — location: [152]() ^ref-7000

---
The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. — location: [154]() ^ref-53296

---
To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth. — location: [158]() ^ref-48988

---
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. — location: [171]() ^ref-24537

---
In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. — location: [300]() ^ref-33756

---
1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. — location: [314]() ^ref-28099

---
To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again. — location: [335]() ^ref-41495

---
If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive. — location: [342]() ^ref-61081

---
If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are. — location: [351]() ^ref-12537

---
The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven’t mastered this foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an elite level. — location: [353]() ^ref-13759

---
“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.” — location: [359]() ^ref-29706

---
To learn requires intense concentration. — location: [368]() ^ref-34447

---
(1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. — location: [383]() ^ref-4964

---
To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. — location: [404]() ^ref-63934

---
the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. — location: [425]() ^ref-410

---
High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) — location: [439]() ^ref-65074

---
The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results. — location: [446]() ^ref-46732

---
By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task. — location: [466]() ^ref-36126

---
the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. — location: [471]() ^ref-17913

---
the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. — location: [478]() ^ref-15443

---
The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. — location: [638]() ^ref-36288

---
If e-mail were to move to the periphery of your workday, you’d be required to deploy a more thoughtful approach to figuring out what you should be working on and for how long. This type of planning is hard. — location: [650]() ^ref-56570

---
The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. — location: [667]() ^ref-28217

---
To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time… it needs a lot of concentration… if you have a job administrating anything, you don’t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I’m irresponsible. I’m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m irresponsible. — location: [682]() ^ref-11129

---
Richard Feynman explaining in an interview one of his less orthodox productivity strategies: To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time… it needs a lot of concentration… if you have a job administrating anything, you don’t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I’m irresponsible. I’m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m irresponsible. — location: [681]() ^ref-2029

---
Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not. — location: [687]() ^ref-4188

---
Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value. — location: [705]() ^ref-38129

---
Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. — location: [706]() ^ref-12691

---
We could, of course, eliminate this anachronistic commitment to busyness if we could easily demonstrate its negative impact on the bottom line, but the metric black hole enters the scene at this point and prevents such clarity. — location: [722]() ^ref-18781

---
If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed. He called such a culture a technopoly, and he didn’t mince words in warning against it. “Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World,” he argued in his 1993 book on the topic. “It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant.” — location: [744]() ^ref-15479

---
This Internet-centrism (to steal another Morozov term) is what technopoly looks like today. — location: [759]() ^ref-12120

---
Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. — location: [772]() ^ref-19665

---
Among them are the realities that deep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the absence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving, and that our culture has developed a belief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,” then it’s good—regardless of its impact on our ability to produce valuable things. — location: [781]() ^ref-51644

---
The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived. — location: [836]() ^ref-58757

---
Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. — location: [853]() ^ref-40725

---
Gallagher’s theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance. — location: [875]() ^ref-46734

---
“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). — location: [928]() ^ref-38397

---
Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. — location: [932]() ^ref-37886

---
you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life. — location: [1001]() ^ref-31549

---
The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanship—not the outcomes of their work. — location: [1010]() ^ref-19508

---
You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. — location: [1091]() ^ref-24649

---
could be discussing some hotshot tech CEO. Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. — location: [1182]() ^ref-17763

---
Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. — location: [1183]() ^ref-47507

---
This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. — location: [1221]() ^ref-40170

---
By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year. — location: [1247]() ^ref-7166

---
By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself. — location: [1295]() ^ref-27387

---
To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. — location: [1316]() ^ref-43249

---
Where you’ll work and for how long. — location: [1323]() ^ref-18306

---
Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog. — location: [1328]() ^ref-43700

---
How you’ll work once you start to work. — location: [1329]() ^ref-6197

---
to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard. — location: [1331]() ^ref-41737

---
How you’ll support your work. — location: [1333]() ^ref-3047

---
To maximize your success, you need to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment. — location: [1337]() ^ref-34238

---
But keep in mind that finding a ritual that sticks might require experimentation, so be willing to work at it. — location: [1339]() ^ref-49278

---
Surrounding such efforts with a complicated (and perhaps, to the outside world, quite strange) ritual accepts this reality—providing your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter. — location: [1342]() ^ref-12353

---
By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy. — location: [1357]() ^ref-51445

---
These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big. — location: [1394]() ^ref-9102

---
the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth. — location: [1481]() ^ref-3228

---
“The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” — location: [1520]() ^ref-56812

---
“If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.” — location: [1526]() ^ref-3729

---
For an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal. — location: [1541]() ^ref-39060

---
I used to focus on lag measures, such as papers published per year. These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a noticeable change to this long-term metric. When I shifted to tracking deep work hours, suddenly these measures became relevant to my day-to-day: Every hour extra of deep work was immediately reflected in my tally. — location: [1543]() ^ref-17689

---
During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. — location: [1569]() ^ref-41762

---
it was not so much the intensity of my deep work periods that increased, but instead their regularity. — location: [1579]() ^ref-17879

---
These efforts, he’s convinced, need the support of a mind regularly released to leisure. — location: [1600]() ^ref-21534

---
At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. — location: [1623]() ^ref-61857

---
The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy. — location: [1631]() ^ref-28298

---
This study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate. — location: [1640]() ^ref-15918

---
The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. — location: [1658]() ^ref-44055

---
Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. — location: [1665]() ^ref-11156

---
The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. — location: [1680]() ^ref-7735

---
It follows, therefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. — location: [1682]() ^ref-3078

---
Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. — location: [1692]() ^ref-23117

---
there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. — location: [1707]() ^ref-32613

---
“Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.” — location: [1718]() ^ref-45283

---
Your mind, in other words, is released from its duty to keep track of these obligations at every moment—your shutdown ritual has taken over that responsibility. — location: [1722]() ^ref-10161

---
When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done. — location: [1729]() ^ref-17168

---
The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. — location: [1757]() ^ref-52142

---
Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom. — location: [1765]() ^ref-65276

---
People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand… they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — location: [1771]() ^ref-65228

---
If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. — location: [1778]() ^ref-58371

---
The strategies that follow are motivated by the key idea that getting the most out of your deep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction. — location: [1783]() ^ref-64748

---
Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. — location: [1805]() ^ref-22824

---
Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. — location: [1810]() ^ref-55144

---
It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. — location: [1814]() ^ref-53027

---
The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom. — location: [1855]() ^ref-54523

---
To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. — location: [1861]() ^ref-34416

---
Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve—providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain. — location: [1897]() ^ref-32752

---
The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. — location: [1915]() ^ref-18873

---
By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration. — location: [1929]() ^ref-60075

---
The key to this strategy is not the specifics, but instead the motivating idea that your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it. — location: [2028]() ^ref-6865

---
Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain focus on something important. — location: [2049]() ^ref-62041

---
I call it the craftsman approach to tool selection, a name that emphasizes that tools are ultimately aids to the larger goals of one’s craft. — location: [2148]() ^ref-55907

---
The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts. — location: [2150]() ^ref-19114

---
The question once again is not whether Twitter offers some benefits, but instead whether it offers enough benefits to offset its drag on your time and attention — location: [2229]() ^ref-15587

---
The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes. — location: [2264]() ^ref-19721

---
But the logical foundation of his proposal, that you both should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work, remains relevant today—especially with respect to the goal of this rule, which is to reduce the impact of network tools on your ability to perform deep work. — location: [2388]() ^ref-39201

---
Fortunately, Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a hundred years earlier: Put more thought into your leisure time. — location: [2404]() ^ref-6981

---
Put more thought into your leisure time. — location: [2405]() ^ref-3901

---
If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing. — location: [2423]() ^ref-54421

---
To summarize, if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative. Not only will this preserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate, but you might even fulfill Arnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of experiencing, perhaps for the first time, what it means to live, and not just exist. — location: [2425]() ^ref-11490

---
I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. — location: [2497]() ^ref-27069

---
Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds. — location: [2537]() ^ref-48647

---
Over time, you should make an effort to accurately (if not somewhat conservatively) predict the time tasks will require. — location: [2542]() ^ref-41133

---
The second tactic that helps is the use of overflow conditional blocks. — location: [2543]() ^ref-51567

---
overflow conditional blocks. If you’re not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it. If you finish the activity on time, however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block (for example, some nonurgent tasks). — location: [2543]() ^ref-48627

---
the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done. Deep work is important, in other words, not because distraction is evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester. — location: [2927]() ^ref-7589

---
I began to more carefully block out deep work hours and preserve them against incursion. — location: [2942]() ^ref-5588
